## Features

These features are all built from scrath by referring to theoretical resources (primarily fundamental of copmuter graphics)

- Phong shading
- Antialiased texture sampling (spherial/vertex uv)
- Image filters including Gaussian/bspline filter
- Reflection (raytracer)
- Shadow
- Basic graphics pipeline
- Perspective correction
- Parallel shading
